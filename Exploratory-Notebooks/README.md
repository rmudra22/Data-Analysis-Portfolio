This folder contains a collection of notebooks from my learning journey in data science. Each notebook focuses on specific skills or concepts, such as data cleaning, visualization, or foundational machine learning techniques. These exercises are from various courses and self-study projects, showing the progress I’ve made as I’ve built up my data science toolkit.
I’ll keep updating this section as I dive into new topics. Each notebook includes comments and explanations to make it easy to follow along with my learning process.
