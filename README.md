# Ruslana Mudra - Data Analysis Portfolio
## Introduction
Welcome here! 

I'm Rusya, and I'm learning Data Analysis and Data Science with mostly an open source information I can get. Always fascinated by the power of data and the insights it can bring to humanity, I decided to embark on my own journey into it! I graduated from Alfred Nobel University in Dnipro, specializing in International Economic Relations, earning my Bachelor's Degree. I am sharing all the projects I'm working on during my learning process, and we'll see what's next :)
